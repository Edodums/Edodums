### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<details>
    <summary><b>âœ¨About Me</b></summary><br/>
    I like to watch animes and reading mangas.<br/>
    I do Calisthenics, and I like to make cocktails.<br/>
    I started working in 2014 but it's only been four year since I've started to be a decent programmer.<br/>
    I'm not perfect, nor I intend to become it, but I strive to at least be an expert in what I like. <br/>
    I :heart: Kotlin, Android Development and I'm starting to do some side projects ( <b>Games</b> ) in Lua ( <b>Defold</b> )

<h4>This doesn't really show what I actually know and used more, but apart from Kotlin I know how to use Python and C# though I'm not really fluent in them. I've used for 6 years PHP, JS ( in any kind of flavour ) and NodeJS. </h4>

At the moment I'm reading the Domain Driven Design book, because I'm starting to feel a sort of sense of stagnation every time I create a new project. <br />
